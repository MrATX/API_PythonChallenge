# API_PythonChallenge
Using multiple API calls to gather global weather data for 500 cities, and graph findings. Completed for U of O Data Analytics Boot Camp.

DISCLAIMER

So it turns out my python environments were not setup correctly to accomodate the widgets and I was using Jupyter Lab instead of Notebook which it turns out is even more dificult with the widgets. So I spent about 6 hours today trying to get the original gmaps import to work; wasn't able to until I finally switched to Notebook. However, at that point I had done so much damage to my environments trying to fix Lab that I couldn't even run pip commands anymore. I'm going to redo my environments over the next few days, however I was not able to complete this assignment in its entirety yet. 


Observations:

The strongest corrleation amongst the weather visualizations appeared to be Latitude and Max Temp (F), with a quasi-parabolic pattern mirroring the earth's curvature with the hottest temperatures residing at the equator, or 0 Lat.

The weight of the humidity % seemed to be of a low sensitivity; the dots appeared nearly identical except for desert areas and did not display any of the amorphous washing effect displayed in the example maps.

The geographic distribution of the various cities meeting the ideal weather criteria was very wide.
